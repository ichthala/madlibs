the small drops of water that torturers let fall ceaselessly
upon one spot of their victim's body, I loved the irradiate
refuge of #{noun2}. In my dreams I found a little of the #{noun3}
I had vainly sought in life, and wandered through old #{plural_noun2}
and enchanted #{plural_noun3}.

Once when the wind was soft and scented I heard the #{noun4}
calling, and #{verb1} endlessly and languorously under strange
stars.\n\n
Once when the gentle rain fell I #{verb2} in a barge down a
sunless stream under the earth till I reached another world
of #{adj1} #{noun5}, #{adj2} #{noun6}, and #{adj3} #{noun7}.

And once I walked through a golden valley that led to shadowy
groves and ruins, and ended in a mighty wall green with
antique vines, and pierced by a little gate of bronze.\n\n"
